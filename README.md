# Time-Series-Analysis

The data is an annual temperature anomalies dataset for the northern hemisphere from 1850
to 2021 by the Climate Research Center at the University of East Anglia in the UK. This data
is a time series since it is a set of observations, each recorded at a specific time, and this is a
discrete set. By selecting the fitted model for this series, this project can draw inferences from
this series. By removing the error terms or rough part, this study could provide a long-term
trend of the annual temperature anomalies, which could help scientists and governments
predict and better prepare for the future phenomenon of temperature anomalies in the
northern hemisphere. It is also possible to detect the cyclic behavior of the annual
temperature anomalies dataset.
